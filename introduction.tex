Modern mobile platforms feature a distribution platform for apps called marketplaces (or app stores).
Third-party developers can publish their apps for free or sell them to users.
Users use marketplaces to discover, purchase, download, and update apps. For example, as of November 2015, the number of apps in the Google Play Store is over 1.7 million apps \cite{appbrain_play_apps}.
These apps have become a valuable data source to mine and extract insight from in both academia and industry.
In the recent years, there has been a noticeable amount of research activities on how to extract meaningful insights from apps data. 
In particular, three single views have dominated the research in mining mobile apps.
First, researchers have mined the listing details data of apps such as ratings and user reviews to analyze user's sentiment and help developers take data-driven informed decisions \cite{fu_2013_KDD,chen_2014_ICSE,kong_2015_CCS}. 
Some have created commercial services for app developers and publishers \cite{appfigures,applause,appannie}
