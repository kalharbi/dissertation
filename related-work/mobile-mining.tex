\subsection{Mining Mobile Applications}
Mining mobile apps at large-scale started to be of interest to researchers (\cite{}, see Table~\ref{tab:table_mobile_mining_studies}).

For example, Fu et al. \cite{fu_2013_KDD} conducted a sentiment analysis on the reviews of over 170,000 mobile apps to identify the common reasons why users like or hate an app. 
They collected listing details data and analyzed the reviews at multiple granularities.
They found that the lack of attractive design was the largest cause of negative reviews. 
However, only listing details data were considered and no design and code data were analyzed.
Viennot et al. \cite{viennot_2014_metrics} developed the largest scale crawler for Android apps, crawling over 1,000,000 apps and analyzing a subset of their listing details and source code to identify library usages and detect dangerous security practices.
Despite the immense scale, they stored the listing details and source code files as plain-text data and used a full-text search engine to query them.
This greatly restricted the applicability of their approach to keyword search and left structured data search unsupported (e.g., user interface layout data).
Shirazi et al. \cite{shirazi_EICS_2013} collected 400 Android apps to analyze the common design patterns of these apps.
They estimated the complexity of each apps design by counting the number of activities, layout files, and images.
They computed descriptive statistics such as the most frequent interface elements and the most common combination of widgets.
