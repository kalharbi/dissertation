\subsection{Mining Mobile Applications}

Researchers have mined the design data for mobile applications.
Shirazi et al. \cite{shirazi_EICS_2013} collected 400 Android apps to analyze the common design patterns of these apps.
They estimated the complexity of each apps design by counting the number of activities, layout files, and images.
They computed descriptive statistics such as the most frequent interface elements and the most common combination of widgets.
