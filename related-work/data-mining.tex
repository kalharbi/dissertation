\section{Data Mining}

Data mining refers to the process of extracting previously unknown information from data  and discovering new patterns in the data \cite{witten2011_data_mining_book}.
Data mining techniques have been applied to find structural patterns in large-scale data from various domains such as business intelligence, fraud detection, and surveillance.
This section describes the most relevant data mining application domains to the work presented in this thesis: Web mining, mining mobile applications, and mining software repositories.
