	% Contribution: Methodology and supporting it by building a non trivial system.
	% 1- Deep across label (code , ui, listing, backend) and hierarchy (deep ui parents, code call graph)
	% 2- Longitudinal (multiple versions) and varieties (multiple categories or scale)
	% More apps in the market, small research studies, single version, -> Less useful results
	Modern software platforms feature digital distribution channels called marketplaces, which have revolutionized the way applications are developed and delivered to users.
	As the number of mobile applications continue to proliferate in marketplaces, the need to fully understand them is ever increasing.
	While researchers have recently started to observe the wealth of information in marketplaces, their efforts have been largely constrained to one view of analysis and a single snapshot in time.
	As a result, the increase number of application updates published to marketplace has largely gone unobserved.
	Such view misses the much larger opportunity of mining applications with both a deep and longitudinal views and utilizing it to create innovative systems.

	This dissertation introduces a deep and longitudinal approach to mining mobile applications embodied in a scalable platform called \textit{Sieveable}.
	We use  the official Android marketplaces as the application for the work presented here; at present, it has the highest number of apps compared to any other software marketplace.
	Sieveable provides efficient retrieval of hundreds of thousands of applications with the goal of enabling a deep and longitudinal analysis of the design and development of mobile applications.
	This work discusses challenges inherent in mining mobile applications at large-scale and presents solutions that can lead to novel applications.
	We demonstrate how Sieveable enables different types of analyses that would have been very difficult to perform otherwise.
	Our goal is to inform marketplace owners, platform engineers, and third-party developers with our findings. 
	We argue that considering both a deep and a longitudinal views result in a more useful analysis to support the design and development of mobile applications.
